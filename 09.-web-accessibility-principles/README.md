The [Web Accessibility Initiative ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) at the [World Wide Web Consortium ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.w3.org/) outlined four main web accessibility principles in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). In order to be accessible, web content must be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

The first letters of these principles form an acronym — **POUR** — which may help you remember them.

The 13 guidelines under the 4 principles are:

**Perceivable:**

* Provide text alternatives for non-text content.&#x20;
* Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia.&#x20;
* Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning.&#x20;
* Make it easier for users to see and hear content.&#x20;

**Operable:**

* Make all functionality available from a keyboard.&#x20;
* Give users enough time to read and use content.&#x20;
* Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions.&#x20;
* Help users navigate and find content.&#x20;
* Make it easier to use inputs other than a keyboard.&#x20;

**Understandable:**

* Make text readable and understandable.&#x20;
* Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.&#x20;
* Help users avoid and correct mistakes.&#x20;

**Robust:**

* Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.&#x20;
