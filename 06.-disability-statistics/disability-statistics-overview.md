# Disability Statistics Overview

### What Percentage of the Population Has a Disability?

Estimates for the percentage of people with a disability range from about 10% to 20%, depending on the survey methodology, definition of the word "disability," and other factors. This means that in a random group of 10 people worldwide, 1 or 2 of those people are likely to have a disability. That's a minority, but it's a rather sizable minority. Of the approximately 7 billion people on the planet, about 700 million to 1.4 billion have disabilities.

We are all susceptible to disabilities. An able-bodied person can acquire a disability through an illness or an accident, which can dramatically change the person's ability to interact with a world that isn't designed with accessibility in mind.

### What Statistics/Trends You Should Know for the CPACC Exam

The CPACC exam will test your knowledge on demographics and statistics of populations living with disabilities in various regions around the world. To prepare, read through the World Health Organizationâ€™s [World report on disability ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/), as well as the [IAAP CPACC Body of Knowledge ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/IAAP_CPACC_BOK_Oct2023), which contains mention of specific statistics that you should know. Focus on gaining a wholistic comprehension of disability trends, rather than just memorizing a list of numbers.

As you review the resources noted above, pay special attention to these topics:

* How many people with disabilities live in a given country, region, or in the world?
* What are the most common disabilities?
* What are the most prevalent disabilities that people who live in poverty live with?
* What percent of the population has blindness, deafness, cognitive disabilities, and physical disabilities?
* What are the percentages of people with different types of disabilities in different age groups?&#x20;
* How many people with disabilities are employed?
* How much disposable income do people with disabilities have?
* How many people with disabilities are below the poverty level?
* How many people with disabilities smoke, are obese, have diabetes or have heart disease?
