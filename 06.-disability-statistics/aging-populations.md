# Aging Populations

### Disabilities Increase as We Get Older

Older people are more likely to have disabilities. Estimates range from about 30% to 60% of older populations, compared to 10%-20% for the population as a whole. Often, we acquire multiple disabilities as a natural part of the aging process. Many of us lose our sight, our hearing, our mobility, and/or our cognition. The combination of multiple disabilities can be challenging for the individuals, which underscores the importance of ensuring accessibility is built into the environment as much as possible.&#x20;

Countries with large aging populations are likely to have a greater proportion of people with disabilities, all other things being equal. (Factors that could change this expected data trend would be poverty and war, which often cause disabilities in younger populations.)

Looking ahead in this digital age, adults who have spent much of their lives using digital technologies will expect to be able to continue using digital technologies even after acquiring disabilities. The market for accessible digital technologies is expected to increase as more technologically-savvy users age and acquire disabilities.

### Data Details for Aging and Disabilities

In countries with life expectancies over 70 years, individuals spend on average about 8 years, or 11.5 per cent of their life span, living with disabilities.
