# Defining Usability

Usability determines how easy a design’s user interface is to use and how functional a product or design is. Key components of usability assess:

* How easy it is for users to learn the basic tasks of the interface;
* If users can perform those tasks quickly;
* If users can recall performing those tasks after time away from the interface;
* The number of errors, the severity of errors, and recovery from errors in the interface; and
* If the design satisfies users.

The effectiveness of the user interface, or fitness for purpose, and how much time goes into using the interface according to the user are evaluated during usability testing.

To gain a better understanding of usability, the video below provides insight into how usability is determined in web design.

> Hi, I’m Jeff Hecker from Athena Brand Wisdom, and thanks for watching this short video on defining website usability.
>
> In this video, I’m going to give you three different ways of thinking about what website usability is.
>
> There are a number of different definitions of usability. The ISO definition of usability is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
>
> But there are, of course, more details and granular ways of thinking about website usability. One framework that I like is Whitney Quesenbery’s famous 5 E’s of usability.
>
> According to this framework, a website with good usability should be:
>
> Effective, which means users can do what they want
>
> Efficient, which means they can do it quickly
>
> Easy to learn
>
> Error tolerant, which means that the site works to prevent errors or if someone makes an error, it helps them to fix the error
>
> and Engaging.
>
> Finally, no discussion of website usability would be complete without some reference to Steve Krug, who has written some really great and highly accessible books about usability.
>
> When he defines usability, he says it really just means making something that works well - that is - that a person of average or even below average ability and experience can use it for its intended purpose without getting hopelessly frustrated.
>
> Steve Krug enhances this definition with his presentation of his first law of usability, which is don’t make me think.&#x20;
>
> This means that, as much as humanly possible, a website should be self-evident, obvious, and self-explanatory.
>
> He writes that designing for usability means working to reduce the amount of thinking that people need to do when using your site by making things as self-evident as possible.
>
> The more people have to stop and think about how to do what they want to do, where to click, where to find things, what things mean, whether something’s clickable, etcetera, the more that confidence in a site and user satisfaction are eroded.
>
> So, to be really specific then, what is a website usability issue?
>
> Well, it’s anything that prevents task completion, slows the user down, takes the user off course, implies that things are okay when they’re not, or causes the user to misinterpret content.
>
> It’s anything that makes errors likely or difficult to recover from, or prevents the user from noticing something important, or from taking the next step.
>
> It’s anything that causes the user to look for a workaround or makes the user confused or irritated.
>
> So, that’s an introduction to how website usability is defined. Thanks for watching!

### **Five E’s of Usability**&#x20;

The **Five E’s of Usability** are key principles that help evaluate and improve the usability of a product, system, or service. They ensure that users can efficiently and effectively interact with a design. The five E’s are:

1. **Effective** – Can users accomplish their goals accurately and completely?
   * A product is effective if it allows users to achieve their intended tasks without errors or confusion.
   * Example: A form submission process should ensure that all necessary fields are completed correctly.
2. **Efficient** – How quickly and easily can users perform tasks?
   * Efficiency refers to minimizing the time and effort needed to complete an action.
   * Example: A search function that delivers relevant results with minimal input improves efficiency.
3. **Engaging** – Is the experience pleasant and satisfying for users?
   * A well-designed interface should be visually appealing, interactive, and enjoyable to use.
   * Example: A beautifully designed website with intuitive navigation enhances user engagement.
4. **Error-tolerant** – Does the system prevent and help users recover from mistakes?
   * Users should be guided to avoid errors, and when mistakes happen, clear feedback and solutions should be provided.
   * Example: Undo functionality in text editors allows users to recover from mistakes easily.
5. **Easy to learn** – Can new users quickly understand and use the system?
   * A product should have an intuitive interface that requires minimal learning effort.
   * Example: A mobile app with clear icons and simple onboarding tutorials makes learning easier.

These principles are essential in **user-centered design** and help improve usability, ensuring a better overall user experience.
