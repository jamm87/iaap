# Procurement Laws

Procurement refers to the process of government entities purchasing goods and services from external sources. There are laws and rules in place, though, that regulate government procurement to ensure that money is spent wisely and to prevent fraud and waste from occurring. When it comes to procuring technologies, there are laws that specifically spell out standards and requirements for purchasing, and these requirements may even address accessibility. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and EN 301 549 are two examples of procurement laws that focus on accessibility.

### United States

#### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the U.S. federal government to take accessibility into account when procuring information technologies: websites, telephones, copiers, computers, and other technologies, including both hardware and software. The parts of Section 508 most relevant to web accessibility are "1194.21 — Software applications and operating systems," "1194.22 — Web-based intranet and internet information and applications," and "1194.31 — Functional performance criteria." In January 2017, Section 508 underwent a refresh that was many years in the making. A significant change is that the WCAG level A and AA guidelines are now incorporated by reference and required by Section 508. Prior to the refresh, Section 508 included its own list of requirements, which were a modified subset of WCAG 1.0 (not the current version of WCAG).

Per Section 508, "when acquiring ICT, agencies must ensure that: Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from an agency have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities."

**Section 508 applies to:**

* US federal government entities only, but the effects of Section 508 have permeated the information technology landscape because so many businesses, non-profits, and local and state governments do business with the federal government. To sell to the federal government, private entities have to offer accessible products and services.

**Section 508 is enforced by:**

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

### Europe

#### EU Procurement Directive (Directive 2014/24/EU)

This directive states: "For all procurement which is intended for use by natural persons, whether general public or staff of the contracting entity, the technical specifications shall, except in duly justified cases, be drawn up so as to take into account accessibility criteria for persons with disabilities or design for all users." If another EU law already stipulates accessibility requirements, then they should be used in the technical specifications.

If another EU law already defines mandatory accessibility requirements, those should be used in the technical specifications.

A supplier may be excluded (from being granted a contract) if they violate "environmental or social obligations, including rules on accessibility for disabled persons."

Finally, electronic means of communication "should also take accessibility for persons with disabilities into due account."

This directive has been transposed into EU member state national laws governing procurement.
