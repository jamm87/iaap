#### EN 301 549: "Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services"

The European standard EN 301 549 is a voluntary harmonized European standard with a broad set of requirements, originally created to provide accessibility requirements for all ICT products and services. It is similar to Section 508 in the United States. This standard has been set up to create equal European procurement requirements in terms of accessibility. The result is [ETSI standard EN 301 549 v.3.2.1 (PDF), ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf)titled "Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services." This most recent established version is v.3.2.1, which was published in March 2021. Like Section 508, EN 301 549 covers different technologies, not just the web. Parts of EN 301 549 relating to the web refer to WCAG 2.1 level AA. It is in line with the expectation that EN 301 549 will also become the applicable standard for the private sector.

Annex A of the standard lists the requirements relevant to the Web Accessibility Directive, which align with WCAG 2.1. There are also requirements for downloadable documents, mobile apps, biometrics, two-way voice communication, accessibility documentation, and support services.

Several European countries already have their own web accessibility laws.

#### EU Directive 2016/2102

[EU Directive 2016/2102 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102) applies to the public sector and has already transpired. Websites, intranets, and extranets had to comply as of September 23, 2020. For mobile apps, the date was June 23, 2021. Directive 2016/2102 refers directly to the European standard EN 301 549.

Directive 2016/2102 does not require procuring accessible solutions (unlike the US), but the websites and apps must be accessible when they are made available to the users. Requirements include the following: Websites and applications must be accessible; an accessibility statement must be provided; there must be a method for users to report accessibility issues; and a link to enforcement procedures must be provided.

#### EU Directive 2019/882

For the private sector, [EU Directive 2019/882 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882) applies. Various sectors are mentioned by name, including e-commerce, banking, e-books, and electronics. This standard must be transposed into national law by June 28, 2022. This legislation must then be applied from June 28, 2025. Directive 2019/882 does **not** directly refer to the European standard EN 301 549.

#### European Accessibility Act (EAA)

On June 7th, 2019 the European Union formally adopted the [European Accessibility Act ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2015%3A0615%3AFIN), which could be compared to the ADA in the United States. The main goal of this Act is to create a common set of accessibility guidelines for EU member states and fix the diverging accessibility requirements. While many EU Member States already have some form of accessibility legislation, there is no EU law on accessibility. The EU member states have had two years to translate the act into their national laws and have four years to apply them (enforcement to commence in 2025). Products and services identified as being most important to people with disabilities are covered, and they include:

* computers and operating systems
* ATMs, ticketing and check-in machines
* smartphones
* TV equipment related to digital television services
* telephone services and related equipment
* access to audio-visual media services such as television broadcast and related consumer equipment
* services related to air, bus, rail and waterborne passenger transport
* banking services
* e-books
* e-commerce

The following harmonized European standards are or will be used to assess conformance with the EAA:

* the revised EN 301 549 standard, ensuring alignment with the Web Accessibility Directive
* the revised EN 17210 standard on the accessibility and usability of the built environment
* the revised EN 17161 Design for All standard on accessibility following a Design for All approach in products, goods and services
* a new standard setting up requirements on the accessibility of non-ICT information related to products
* a new standard for the accessibility of support services related to products and services (help desks, call centers, technical support, relay services and training services)&#x20;
* a new standard for the accessibility of emergency communications and for the answering of emergency communications (including to the single European Emergency number 112).&#x20;

Per the EAA, non-government organizations, the responsible national authority, or other bodies are permitted to go to court on behalf of a person under national law. It also permits penalties for failure to comply with accessibility standards. EU member states are each responsible for enforcing the act.

#### The Equality Act of 2010

One of the main laws related to web accessibility in the UK is the Equality Act of 2010. The Equality Act is a broad law which prohibits discrimination in the workplace and in society in general on the basis of:

* Disability
* Race or ethnic identity
* Sex
* Pregnancy or parenthood status
* Sexual orientation or identity
* Religion, belief, or lack of religion/belief

The Equality Act replaced and now supersedes three laws that named specific populations:

* Sex Discrimination Act 1975&#x20;
* Race Relations Act 1976&#x20;
* Disability Discrimination Act 1995

Bringing the legislation for all of these types of protected populations and conditions under one law helps simplify the legal situation in terms of civil rights in the public sector. Citizens may file a complaint and pursue legal action if warranted.

The Equality Act applies specifically to public authorities "and to any other organisation when it is carrying out a public function."

According to Out-law.com:

> While the EQA does not expressly refer to websites, the consensus has been that the reference to the "provision of a service" applies to commercial web services as much as to traditional services.
