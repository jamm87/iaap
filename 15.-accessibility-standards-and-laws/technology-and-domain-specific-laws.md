# Technology and Domain-Specific Laws

In a broad sense, information technology law provides legal outlines and regulations for distributing, collecting, and storing electronic information. While there is no single law that can be called information technology law, there are a number of laws that concentrate on various aspects of technology, such as data protection and privacy, intellectual property, hardware and software, telecommunications, and the Internet. When it comes to technology and accessibility, there are several laws throughout the world that focus on technology accessibility requirements, particularly regarding the Internet.

### United States

#### 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)

"The CVAA updates federal communications law to increase the access of persons with disabilities to modern communications. The CVAA makes sure that accessibility laws enacted in the 1980s and 1990s are brought up to date with 21st century technologies, including new digital, broadband, and mobile innovations."

The CVAA requires "advanced communications services and products" to be accessible to people with disabilities, including video communications, text messaging, web browsers on mobile devices, and other similar technologies. Perhaps of greater significance to web developers, all video programs presented with captions on television must be presented with closed-captions on the internet. As it is written, the CVAA does not explicitly apply to web-only videos, but the video captioning requirement in WCAG applies to videos of all kinds on the internet, whether broadcast on television or not.

**The CVAA applies to:**

* All entities already covered by FCC regulations (namely: telecommunication hardware and software providers and television broadcasters and television hardware/software providers)

**The CVAA is enforced by:**

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

#### Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)

The ACAA of 1986 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel and requires air carriers to accommodate the needs of passengers with disabilities. In March 1990, the Department of Transportation (DoT) issued a rule defining the rights of passengers and the obligations of air carriers as a direct result of this law. On November 12, 2013 the DoT issued rule ([DOT-OST-2011-0177-0111 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/DOT-OST-2011-0177/document)) regarding the accessibility of carrier websites and ticket kiosks, which will require these sites and kiosks to be accessible to people with disabilities. The final rule published was published in the Federal Register ([FR Vol. 78 No. 218 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-11-12/pdf/2013-26749.pdf)) on November 12, 2013 and went into effect on December 12, 2013, thirty days after publication.&#x20;

U.S. and foreign air carriers operating flights within or to the U.S. or selling tickets to the U.S. public are required to ensure that the public-facing content of websites that they own or control conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA. The requirements apply to both U.S. air carriers’ public-facing pages and foreign carriers’ public-facing pages that are used to advertise or sell to the U.S. public for air transportation that begins or ends in the U.S. The regulations apply to core air travel services as of June 30, 2016 and to the entire site as of December 2016. Core air travel services are defined in [14 CFR 382.43 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7cf314f3946fa4efd60bb82e0b62150e\&node=pt14.4.382\&rgn=div5#se14.4.382_143)to include portions of the site related to seven core activities:

1. Booking or changing a reservation, including all flight amenities;
2. Checking in for a flight;
3. Accessing a personal travel itinerary;
4. Accessing the status of a flight;
5. Accessing a personal frequent flyer account;
6. Accessing flight schedules; and
7. Accessing carrier contact information.

By implication, this also includes the general portions of the site users need to navigate through to access these services. In effect, this provides some degree of blanket coverage for making sites compliant that will be in effect as of the December 12, 2015 deadline.

**The ACAA applies to:**

* U.S. and foreign air carriers operating flights within or to the U.S. or selling tickets to the U.S. public&#x20;

**The ACAA is enforced by:**&#x20;

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

#### Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2017

"Access for individuals with disabilities in air transportation must move into the 21st century to compete in today’s job market or enjoy the opportunities available to other citizens of the United States. Aircraft must be designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities and air carriers must acquire aircraft that meet broad accessibility standards."

#### State Web Accessibility Laws

Many U.S. States have their own web accessibility laws, usually aimed at state and local government, which can include K-12 schools and universities.&#x20;

### Canada

#### Web Standards for the Government of Canada <a href="#id32_web_standards_for_the_government_of_canada" id="id32_web_standards_for_the_government_of_canada"></a>

The government of Canada has published web standards for accessibility, usability, interoperability, and mobile devices. These guidelines apply to the government, and do not apply explicitly to the private sector.

### Europe

#### European Union

**EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD)**

"The AVMSD (Directive 2010/13/EU) governs EU-wide coordination of national legislation on all audiovisual media — traditional TV broadcasts and on-demand services."

Per this directive, "services provided by media service providers under their jurisdiction \[must be] made continuously and progressively more accessible to persons with disabilities through proportionate measures." Additionally, emergency information made available through audiovisual media services must be accessible to people with disabilities, and media service providers are encouraged to create action plans to increase the accessibility of their services.

**European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972)**

The rules in this directive pertain to supplying high quality, secure, and affordable telecommunication services in Europe, including providing equivalent access and choice to users with disabilities.

Some of the requirements are:

* Service information and an easily readable contract summary must be provided in an accessible format.&#x20;
* Missing children and child helpline hotlines must be accessible.&#x20;
* Emergency services and emergency communication must be accessible.&#x20;
* Support to consumers with disabilities must be provided.&#x20;
* Specific equipment and services that promote equivalent access must be available and affordable.&#x20;

**EU eIDAS regulation**

"The eIDAS Regulation (on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market) requires that trust services provided and end-user products be accessible for persons with disabilities, such as with eSignatures which aid in signing legal documents and email in a paperless manner."

#### France <a href="#id165france" id="id165france"></a>

The French Law 2005-102, passed in 2005, can be somewhat compared to the United States ADA. It focuses on ensuring physical and digital accessibility for people with disabilities. With respect to digital accessibility, French government websites and public services are required to comply with the _Référentiel général d'amélioration de l'accessibilité_ (RGAA), which is based on WCAG Level AA.
