#### The Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities

One of the actions Japan took to eradicate social barriers for people with disabilities was establishing the Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities in June 2013. The legislation prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires organizations and private entities to provide the necessary accommodations that remove the social barriers people with disabilities face.
