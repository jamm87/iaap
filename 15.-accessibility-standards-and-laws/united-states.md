### The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The ADA is a broad civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, architectural design, transportation, examinations and courses, and other services offering "public accommodation." Even though the ADA says nothing about web accessibility explicitly, many of the web accessibility lawsuits in the United States invoke the ADA as the basis for the legal complaint, because of the language about "public accommodation."

**The ADA applies to:**&#x20;

* Private entities that own, operate, lease, or lease to places of public accommodation. Essentially this refers to businesses and other organizations open to the public, with the exception of religious entities and private clubs.
* Federal and state government entities.

**The ADA is enforced by:**

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the U.S. federal government to take accessibility into account when procuring information technologies: websites, telephones, copiers, computers, and other technologies, including both hardware and software. The parts of Section 508 most relevant to web accessibility are "1194.21 — Software applications and operating systems," "1194.22 — Web-based intranet and internet information and applications," and "1194.31 — Functional performance criteria." In January 2017, Section 508 underwent a refresh that was many years in the making. A significant change is that the WCAG 2.0 level A and AA guidelines are now incorporated by reference and required by Section 508. Prior to the refresh, Section 508 included its own list of requirements, which were a modified subset of WCAG 1.0 (not WCAG 2.0).

**Section 508 applies to:**

* US federal government entities only, but the effects of Section 508 have permeated the information technology landscape because so many businesses, non-profits, and local and state governments do business with the federal government. To sell to the federal government, private entities have to offer accessible products and services.

**Section 508 is enforced by:**

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

### 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)

The CVAA requires "advanced communications services and products" to be accessible to people with disabilities, including video communications, text messaging, web browsers on mobile devices, and other similar technologies. Perhaps of greater significance to web developers, all video programs presented with captions on television must be presented with closed-captions on the internet. As it is written, the CVAA does not explicitly apply to web-only videos, but the video captioning requirement in WCAG 2.0 applies to videos of all kinds on the internet, whether broadcast on television or not.

**The CVAA applies to:**

* All entities already covered by FCC regulations (namely: telecommunication hardware and software providers and television broadcasters and television hardware/software providers)

**Section 508 is enforced by:**

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

### Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)

The ACAA of 1986 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel and requires air carriers to accommodate the needs of passengers with disabilities. In March 1990, the Department of Transportation (DoT) issued a rule defining the rights of passengers and the obligations of air carriers as a direct result of this law. On November 12, 2013 the DoT issued rule ([DOT-OST-2011-0177-0111 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=DOT-OST-2011-0177-0111)) regarding the accessibility of carrier websites and ticket kiosks, which will require these sites and kiosks to be accessible to people with disabilities. The final rule published was published in the Federal Register ([FR Vol. 78 No. 218 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-11-12/pdf/2013-26749.pdf)) on November 12, 2013 and went into effect on December 12, 2013, thirty days after publication.&#x20;

U.S. and foreign air carriers operating flights within or to the U.S. or selling tickets to the U.S. public are required to ensure that the public-facing content of websites that they own or control conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA. The requirements apply to both U.S. air carriers’ public-facing pages and foreign carriers’ public-facing pages that are used to advertise or sell to the U.S. public for air transportation that begins or ends in the U.S. The regulations apply to core air travel services as of December 12, 2015 and to the entire site as of December 12, 2016. Core air travel services are defined in [14 CFR 382.43 ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7cf314f3946fa4efd60bb82e0b62150e\&node=pt14.4.382\&rgn=div5#se14.4.382_143) to include portions of the site related to seven core activities:

1. Booking or changing a reservation, including all flight amenities;
2. Checking in for a flight;
3. Accessing a personal travel itinerary;
4. Accessing the status of a flight;
5. Accessing a personal frequent flyer account;
6. Accessing flight schedules; and
7. Accessing carrier contact information.

By implication, this also includes the general portions of the site users need to navigate through to access these services. In effect, this provides some degree of blanket coverage for making sites compliant that will be in effect as of the December 12, 2015 deadline.

**The ACAA applies to:**

* U.S. and foreign air carriers operating flights within or to the U.S. or selling tickets to the U.S. public&#x20;

**The ACAA is enforced by:**&#x20;

* Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

#### Note:

As of December 11, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation extended the deadline of the first phase of ACAA (accessibility of core travel services) to June 30, 2016.

### State Web Accessibility Laws

Many U.S. States have their own web accessibility laws, usually aimed at state and local government, which can include K-12 schools and universities.
