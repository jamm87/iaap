# The Equality Act 2010

This act was passed in the United Kingdom in 2010. Its purpose was to unify and strengthen anti-discrimination laws in the workplace and society.&#x20;

It prohibits discrimination based on protected characteristics, including explicitly disability. It protects against direct and indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination occurs when people with disabilities are directly treated worse because of their disability. Indirect discrimination occurs when a policy that is applicable to everyone causes a disadvantage to people with disabilities.&#x20;

A few specific provisions in the Act relate to accessible transport, accessibility for students with disabilities, and setting limitations on when employers can ask job applications questions about disability or health.&#x20;
