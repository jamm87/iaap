# Civil Rights Laws

A civil right is an individualâ€™s right to freedom and to equal treatment, to not be subjected to discrimination based on certain characteristics. Civil rights legislation looks to protect rights such as privacy and freedom of speech, as well as protect people from discrimination in multiple settings, such as employment, housing, public spaces, and education. To protect people with disabilities, countries like the United States and Japan have enacted laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and protect the rights of people with disabilities. Below are a few of the common laws that protect rights for people with disabilities.

### United States

#### The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The ADA is a broad civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, architectural design, transportation, examinations and courses, and other services offering "public accommodation." Although the original ADA did not mention web accessibility explicitly, in April 2024, Title II, which applies to state and local government entities, was updated and now requires that their websites and mobile apps will adhere to WCAG 2.1, Level AA. The compliance deadlines are between April 2026 and April 2027.

Additionally, many of the web accessibility lawsuits in the United States invoke the ADA as the basis for the legal complaint, because of the language about "public accommodation," (which falls under Title III).

**The ADA applies to:**&#x20;

* Private entities that own, operate, lease, or lease to places of public accommodation. Essentially this refers to businesses and other organizations open to the public, with the exception of religious entities and private clubs.
* Federal and state government entities.

**The ADA is enforced by:**

* The US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, and in the case of educational institutions by the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, through consent decrees and settlements.

**Under Chapter 126, Equal Opportunity for Individuals with Disabilities, the Congress finds that:**

(1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability also have been subjected to discrimination;&#x20;

(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem;&#x20;

(3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services;&#x20;

(4) unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination;&#x20;

(5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities;&#x20;

(6) census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally;&#x20;

(7) the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and

(8) the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity.&#x20;

### European Union

#### Employment Equality Directive

This directive, adopted in 2000, prohibits discrimination based on disability in employment and occupation and requires reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities. All EU member states have transposed it into national law.

In 2008, a general Anti-Discrimination Directive was proposed (applicable to realms outside of employment), but it has not been adopted. This means that different countries have different approaches in their anti-discrimination laws. As an example, in the realm of healthcare, EU member state legislature falls into 1 of 4 categories:

* Prohibits disability discrimination and requires reasonable accommodation
* Prohibits disability discrimination only
* Requires reasonable accommodation only
* Neither prohibits disability discrimination nor requires reasonable accommodation

### Canada

#### Ontario: The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) <a href="#id32_ontario_aoda" id="id32_ontario_aoda"></a>

The AODA "applies to every person or organization in the public and private sectors of the Province of Ontario, including the Legislative Assembly of Ontario" if the person or organization "provides goods, services or facilities... employs persons in Ontario... offers accommodation... owns or occupies a building, structure or premises... or is engaged in a prescribed business, activity or undertaking or meets such other requirements as may be prescribed."

#### Ontarians with Disabilities Act of 2001

The purpose of this act is to ensure the rights of people with disabilities to equal opportunities and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability.

### European Union

#### Employment Equality Directive (year 2000)

This directive prohibits discrimination based on disability in employment and occupation and requires reasonable accommodations to be provided. All EU member states have transposed this directive into law.

### United Kingdom

#### The Equality Act of 2010

One of the main laws related to web accessibility in the UK is the Equality Act of 2010. The Equality Act is a broad law which prohibits discrimination in the workplace and in society in general on the basis of:

* Disability
* Race or ethnic identity
* Sex
* Pregnancy or parenthood status
* Sexual orientation or identity
* Religion, belief, or lack of religion/belief

The Equality Act replaced and now supersedes three laws that named specific populations:

* Sex Discrimination Act 1975&#x20;
* Race Relations Act 1976&#x20;
* Disability Discrimination Act 1995

Bringing the legislation for all of these types of protect populations and conditions under one law helps simplify the legal situation in terms of civil rights in the public sector. Citizens may file a complaint and pursue legal action if warranted.

The Equality Act applies specifically to public authorities "and to any other organisation when it is carrying out a public function."

According to Out-law.com:

> While the EQA does not expressly refer to websites, the consensus has been that the reference to the "provision of a service" applies to commercial web services as much as to traditional services.

### Japan

#### The Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities

One of the actions Japan took to eradicate social barriers for people with disabilities was establishing the Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities in June 2013. The legislation prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires organizations and private entities to provide the necessary accommodations that remove the social barriers people with disabilities face.
