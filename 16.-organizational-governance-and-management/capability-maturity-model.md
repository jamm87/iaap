# Capability Maturity Model

The Capability Maturity Model (CCM) for Software was developed in 2006 by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Its intended realm is for software development, but it can also be applied to describe the accessibility efforts of an organization.&#x20;

### Maturity Levels

#### 1. Initial

Capability is ad hoc and unstable. The organization doesnâ€™t have an established process for ensuring that products, services, and information are accessible.

#### 2. Policies in Place

The organization has established policies for managing projects and procedures for accessibility. The processes are: practiced, documented, enforced, trained, measured, and able to be improved.

#### 3. Defined

Standard processes to develop and maintain accessibility on an organizational level are documented and they are part of a unified, coherent approach. Processes are modified as needed to increase efficiency.

#### 4. Managed

Well-defined, measurable goals are established for products and processes.&#x20;

#### 5. Optimizing

Continuous, proactive process improvement is prevalent in the entire organization. Weaknesses are identified and corrected, while effective solutions are replicated and transferred throughout the organization.&#x20;

The key practices that allow an organization to progress through the various maturity levels include the following features:

* **Commitment to perform**: Establishment of organizational policies and senior management sponsorship.&#x20;
* **Ability to perform**: Resources, organizational structures, and training.&#x20;
* **Activities performed**: Establishment of plans and procedures, performing and tracking work, taking corrective action as needed.&#x20;
* **Measurement and analysis**: Examples of measurements for determining the status and effectiveness of the activities performed.&#x20;
* **Verifying implementation**: Reviews and audits by management and quality assurance.
