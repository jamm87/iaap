# Organizational Governance and Management

### Introduction:

To support continuous efforts to address accessibility issues, organizations should develop a way to manage, govern, and enforce accessibility standards and best practices. Usual responses to accessibility issues have been to remediate issues once they have been discovered and retrofit accessibility into existing products and services. Establishing accessibility governance and management will help organizations avoid the expensive and legal consequences of addressing accessibility on an as-needed basis; and it will help promote accessibility awareness within the organization. This section will examine how organizational governance and management can be established and maintained.
