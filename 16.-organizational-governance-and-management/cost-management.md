# Cost Management

Cost management is closely related to [time management ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](time-management.md), which was the focus of the previous section. In fact, nearly all of the cost of accessibility will be in the time it takes to get things done. There are a couple of possible exceptions:

### Third Party Accessibility Consultants

Sometimes it makes sense to hire third-party accessibility consultants, like [Deque ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://deque.com/?__hstc=213731083.24f6fe5809ad34e10491c5903ab1c04c.1733154076120.1746179173368.1746200958588.87&__hssc=213731083.1.1746200958588&__hsfp=3850917216), to help with a project, especially on a short-term basis. The costs can vary widely, depending on the type of services you need. Services in a web development context might include:&#x20;

* Evaluating existing web content
* Filing accessibility bugs in your bug tracking system
* Training your team
* Working side-by-side with your developers
* Consulting with management on accessibility process strategies
* Creating accessible content
* Fixing inaccessible content

### Software

Accessibility software can be another expense. Free browser extensions like [axe DevTools ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.deque.com/axe/?__hstc=213731083.24f6fe5809ad34e10491c5903ab1c04c.1733154076120.1746179173368.1746200958588.87&__hssc=213731083.1.1746200958588&__hsfp=3850917216) don't add any cost, but enterprise-level applications like [axe Monitor ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://www.deque.com/axe/monitor/?__hstc=213731083.24f6fe5809ad34e10491c5903ab1c04c.1733154076120.1746179173368.1746200958588.87&__hssc=213731083.1.1746200958588&__hsfp=3850917216) (which can scan entire web sites and produce comprehensive reports) are more expensive.

You may also need to invest in licenses of assistive technologies like JAWS or ZoomText.
