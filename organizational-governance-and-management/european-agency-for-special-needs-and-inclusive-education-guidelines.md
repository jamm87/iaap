# European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education Guidelines

**The European Agency for Special Needs & Inclusive Education** does work and supports endeavors related to disability inclusion. It has published free Guidelines that offer guidance to organizations seeking to produce accessible information.

**The 7 broad recommendations are:**

1. Include an accessibility statement in the organization’s long-term strategy&#x20;
2. Develop a strategy or plan for implementing accessible information&#x20;
3. Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources&#x20;
4. Plan an incremental implementation – be ambitious and modest at the same time&#x20;
5. Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes&#x20;
6. Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff&#x20;
7. When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check&#x20;

**The Guidelines provide a model of how an organization could implement them:**

**Policy**

* Develop a long-term strategy that recognizes all aspects of disability
* Publish an accessibility statement
* Ensure the procurement policy covers accessibility compliance

**Plan**

* Develop an information accessibility plan. It should be detailed and realistic and cover specific steps to follow&#x20;
* Ensure the person or team responsible for the plan has the necessary authority and resources.&#x20;

**Practice**

* Enact a pilot trial of the guidelines&#x20;
* Provide awareness training for staff&#x20;
* Provide accessibility training for content specialists in tools to make information accessible.&#x20;
* Create style guides and templates&#x20;
* Use the style guides and templates to create information&#x20;
* Ensure that external content providers (such as authors, web developers, media producers, etc.) are provided with the Guidelines and comply with them
* Test for accessibility prior to release
