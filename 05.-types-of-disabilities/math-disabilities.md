# Math Disabilities

Math and Computational disabilities affect a person's ability to learn and communicate math. Two examples are:

* **Dyscalculia:** the inability to understand arithmetic and how to calculate
* **Dysgraphia:** the inability to draw or copy figures and graphs

Some signs that may indicate dyscalculia are:

* Not understanding that 10 (the number) and ten (the word) are the same thing
* Trouble with counting money or making change
* Remembering math facts like times tables
* Understanding the logic behind math

Some people experience math anxiety, which is an emotional or psychological fear that grips them when confronted with math problems. While not classified as a disability, it can negatively affect their ability to do math.

## Challenges & Solutions for People with Math Disabilities

#### Learning Goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. **Identify accessibility challenges** that people who have math disabilities experience.
2. **Match the challenges** with appropriate:
   * **Assistive technologies** (products or items that people can use)
   * **Adaptive strategies** (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)
