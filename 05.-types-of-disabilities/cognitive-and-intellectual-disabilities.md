# Cognitive and Intellectual Disabilities

### Cognitive Disabilities

Cognitive disabilities can arise as a result of congenital conditions that are with an individual from birth, or developmental conditions that are with a person from a young age. They can also result from traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalances, or other conditions later in life.

Cognitive disabilities can affect one or more mental functions by varying degrees. Subcategories of disabilities that fall under this category are:

* **Intellectual Disabilities:** Characterized by significant limitations in intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem solving) and in adaptive behavior. Typically, a person with such a disability has an IQ below 70-75.
* **Reading and Dyslexia:** Affecting a person's ability to read.
* **Math and Computation:** Affecting a person's ability to learn and communicate math.
* **ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder):** characterized by inattention/distraction and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity.

There is no one way to describe cognitive disabilities. There are so many different kinds, and so many variations within those kinds. A specific individual may experience a challenge in only one area, rather than all of them. Still, there are some trends or categories worth listing, not because they apply to everyone, but because they are part of the cognitive disability spectrum.

#### ADHD

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is a disorder where a person has difficulty focusing, paying attention, and controlling his or her behavior. The person may also be hyperactive. ADHD typically starts during childhood and may continue into adulthood. Causes of ADHD are unknown, but genetics and environmental factors may play a role in causing ADHD. Experiences with ADHD are divided into two groups of symptoms: inattention / distraction and hyperactive / impulsive. A person may have symptoms from one or both categories.

The inattention/distraction criteria include:

* Diminished attention to detail
* Trouble with attention span
* Easily distracted
* Difficulty with starting, organizing and finishing tasks
* Being forgetful or losing items

The hyperactive / impulsive criteria include:

* Being restless or fidgety
* Having difficulty remaining seated
* Talking excessively
* Having difficulty waiting their turn

#### Autism Spectrum Disorders

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) refers to a diverse group of conditions related to brain development. They include difficulty with communicating and social interaction, as well as unusual patterns of activities and behaviors. Asperger Syndrome (also known as Asperger's Syndrome) is classified as a form of ASD.

The two main criteria for diagnosing ASD are:

* Difficulty with social communication and interaction, present in different contexts (for example, at home and at school).
* Repetitive behaviors, for example, routines or movements.

#### Non-Verbal Learning Disability

This type of disability (abbreviated as NLD) is commonly considered a milder form of Asperger Syndrome. People with NLD have normal intelligence and language development but struggle with social skills, sensory input, and making transitions.

### Intellectual Disabilities

People with intellectual disabilities have significant limitations in reasoning, learning, and/or problem solving. Note that terminology may vary by country. An intellectual disability in one place may be called a learning disability elsewhere.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Revision (DSM-V) published by the American Psychiatric Association, the three main criteria to diagnose an intellectual disability are:

* The person has limitations in intellectual function.
* The person has significant limitations in adaptive behavior (social and communication skills, skills used to manage work or school).
* These limitations manifest during childhood.

### Web Accessibility for Cognitive and Intellectual Disabilities

#### Limited Comprehension

Most people with cognitive or intellectual disabilities experience limited comprehension of one kind or another. Some people may not be able to understand complex ideas. They may have difficulty with metaphors or abstract language. They may not understand some kinds of slang or idiomatic expressions. Some people with cognitive disabilities have exceptionally high cognitive functions in one area — the ability to remember numbers or conversations — but lower cognitive functions in other areas, such as social skills or emotional awareness.

#### Low Tolerance for Cognitive Overload

Some people with cognitive or intellectual disabilities may easily become frustrated or upset when they sense difficult situations, or when there are too many things in their environment happening at the same time. They may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the moment. They need things to be simple and straightforward. Too many choices can cause them to freeze, and they may be unable to change their state of mind for a period of time.

#### Limited Problem-Solving Skills

When presented with a problem to solve, some people with cognitive or intellectual disabilities may simply be unable to solve it, so they may not even attempt to solve it. If a website requires users to type in text in a CAPTCHA (like the CAPTCHA shown in the screen shot below), for instance, they not be able to process what kind of action is required.

If they type an incorrect response and get an error message, they may not be able to figure out why they got the error message, or how to solve the problem.

#### Short Term Memory Loss

Some people with cognitive or intellectual disabilities have a hard time remembering things from one moment to the next. Their brains don't allow them to focus on new information, so they don't retain it in the short term. Long web processes — such as online purchasing procedures, account sign-up procedures, or setting preferences — can cause users to forget what they were doing, or to lose track of information that they may need to remember from one step to the next.

#### Attention Deficit

Some users experience attention deficits, making it hard for them to focus on the task at hand. They may get lost in their own thoughts, or they may find online advertisements too distracting, causing them to forget why they went to the website in the first place.

## Challenges & Solutions for People with Cognitive Disabilities

#### Learning Goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. **Identify accessibility challenges** that people who have cognitive disabilities experience.
2. **Match the challenges** with appropriate:
   * **Assistive technologies** (products or items that people can use)
   * **Adaptive strategies** (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)
