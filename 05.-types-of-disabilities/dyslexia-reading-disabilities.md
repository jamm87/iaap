# Dyslexia/Reading Disabilities

### Difficulty Reading

Many people with cognitive disabilities experience difficulty reading. Some read at a lower level than their peers of the same age, and some can't read at all. It can help to provide illustrations or audio to supplement text. Some people with dyslexia have high levels of cognitive functioning at a conceptual level, but visual encoding of text can be difficult, so they have a hard time spelling or reading words.

### Dyslexia Simulation

Some people have described their experiences of reading with dyslexia as letters appearing to move around, switch around, and swap in and out of place. Below is an animated image of the first paragraph on this page with the letters of each word in the paragraph moving around. This may be how the paragraph appears to someone who has dyslexia.

## Challenges & Solutions with Dyslexia and Reading Disabilities

#### Learning Goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. **Identify accessibility challenges** that people who have dyslexia or other reading disabilities experience.
2. **Match the challenges** with appropriate:
   * **Assistive technologies** (products or items that people can use)
   * **Adaptive strategies** (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)
