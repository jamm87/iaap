# Speech and Language Disabilities

When a person has difficulty with articulating words, he or she may have a speech disability. Speech disabilities are characterized by the inability to produce or organize speech sounds and syllables correctly or with fluency. There may also be a total loss of voice. Some speech disabilities may be genetic, while other causes of speech disability may include learning disabilities, auditory disabilities, Autism spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and cancer (oral or laryngeal). Speech disabilities may also be caused by structural problems such as cleft lip palate.

### Types of Speech Disabilities

Speech disabilities encompass a large number of specific speech disorders. Here are some of the more common types of speech disabilities:&#x20;

* **Stuttering** is a speech disability that affects the fluency of speech sounds. Words or parts of words may be involuntarily repeated, speech sounds may be prolonged, or speech sounds may be stopped or blocked completely.
* Sometimes categorized as a language disability, **Cluttering** is a disability that affects the fluency of speech. Cluttering consists of rapid speech that may be inconsistent in rhythm and lack syntax, or grammar. Speech may be clear at first, but increases at a quick rate. Slurred speech may also occur.
* **Apraxia** is a motor speech disability that occurs when a person has difficulty using muscles for speech production to form sounds of words. It may take a person several attempts to say the correct word.
* **Aphasia** results from injury to the brain (most commonly from stroke) and affects all use of language - the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write.
* **Dysarthria** is a motor speech disability that occurs due to brain damage. The muscles for speech production are affected, causing slurred speech, slow speech, mumbling, or a voice that may sound hoarse or breathy.
* **Speech sound disorders** are disorders where certain sounds of speech may be difficult to produce, specifically consonant sounds. They are generally categorized as articulation disorders or phonemic disorders.
  * Articulation disorders involve difficulty in physically producing speech sounds. As a result, certain speech sounds may be either omitted or added, substituted for other sounds, or the sound is distorted.
  * Phonemic disorders involve difficulty in distinguishing speech sounds in languages. Only a few sounds may be used, thus affecting word meaning. For example, the words "call" and "tall" may both be pronounced as "tall", even though the person may be attempting to use the word "call" and its meaning in his or her statement.
* **Muteness (mutism)** is the complete inability to produce a speaking voice. Neurogenic mutism is caused by brain injury. Psychogenic mutism is caused by psychological issues. The three types of psychogenic mutism are:
  * **Elective mutism** – a person chooses not to speak
  * **Selective mutism** – a person wants to speak but can’t always do so due to anxiety
  * **Total mutism** – a person does not speak at all

### Communication Options

#### Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)

Augmentative and Alternative Communication, or AAC, is comprised of all of the different types of communication outside of oral speech that people with speech disabilities can use to express themselves. Those with severe speech disabilities may use AAC to either supplement their speech or replace their speech altogether. There are two different types of AAC people with speech disabilities can use: unaided AAC or aided AAC.

**Unaided AAC**

Unaided augmentative and alternative communication systems do not rely on the use of external tools, but rely on nonverbal communication like body language, facial expressions, gestures and sign language.

**Aided AAC**

Aided augmentative and alternative communication systems rely on the use of an electronic or non-electronic tool and the person's body. Tools can range communication books and boards, to pen and paper, to electronic devices that produce computer-generated voices. Communication aids that do not require electricity are referred to as low-tech communication aids. Those that do require electricity are high-tech communication aids and often allow people to store and retrieve messages.

The video below shows how high-tech AAC has impacted the life of Rachel Monk.

> \[Narrator's Voice speaking as Rachel, Music plays in the background]: My name is Rachel Monk. I really enjoy going to the art club where I can socialize with my friends. It is great to be able to spend time with everyone while doing something I enjoy so much. I was excluded from doing my exams at school but that didn't stop me. I went to college and studied fine arts and I got an "A" level. I can hear and see and understand everything you say to me. It can be very hard with strangers as a lot of people do not give me enough time to speak. They do not realize how long it
>
> \[Transition to Rachel's computer-generated voice] takes for me to select the icons I need to respond to them. I am a bright person and intelligent, and I want my thoughts and feelings to be heard and not wasted. Everyone has the right to communicate. I may sound different in my head to how I sound to others, but it is all my voice. Now hear me...
