# Talking to People with Disabilities

### Address the Person Directly

If the person who has a disability has a companion or interpreter with him or her, the person should be acknowledged and addressed directly. Do not make direct statements intended for the person to his or her companion. For people who use wheelchairs, consider sitting in a chair or at least standing further back when engaged in a lengthy conversation. This allows the person in the wheelchair to maintain eye contact without putting much stress on his or her neck. The table below provides other suggestions for speaking with people with disabilities.
