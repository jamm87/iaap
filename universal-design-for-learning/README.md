Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an approach to designing curricula that eliminates barriers in the learning environment in order to improve educational experiences for all learners. All aspects of learning are designed to be modified based on various learner needs. These components of learning design include instructional goals and objectives, methods of instructional delivery, materials used for learning, and assessments. In this section, we will closely examine how the principles of UDL, which are multiple means of representation, action and expression, and engagement, are used to develop these instructional components based on students' diverse abilities.
