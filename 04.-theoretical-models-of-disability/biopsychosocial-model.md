# Biopsychosocial Model

The biopsychosocial model recognizes that disability is a complex and multi-faceted concept and incorporates the perspectives of the medical and social models. This includes the biological, individual, and social aspects of disability.

This model is the basis for the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), a publication by the World Health Organization in 2002.

### Strengths of the Biopsychosocial Model

This model takes into account multiple facets of disability (biological, psychological, and social) and is useful in rehabilitation, allowing health and social care workers to develop more robust support for people with disabilities.

### Weaknesses of the Biopsychosocial Model

Combining health and social factors in defining disability may possibly downplay the medical needs of people with disabilities.
