# Contrast

### Don't Assume Everyone Has Perfect Vision

> #### Ensure Sufficient Contrast
>
> Ensure the contrast of the text against the background is sufficient to allow the text to be read easily.

Some people with low vision see in low contrast, making it hard for them to read text if the color and brightness of the text are too similar to the background behind the text. You don't always have to use the highest contrast (white against black or black against white), but you do need to choose colors that don't make reading difficult.

####

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Good Example

This text is easy to read because it is the highest contrast possible: black against white.
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Bad Example

The text below says "This text is harder to read because it is black on blue"

<mark style="background-color:blue;">This text is harder to read because it is black on blue</mark>
{% endhint %}
