# Mobile Devices

### Hardware Accessibility

Mobile devices put the power of computing, and the power of the Internet, in our hands and at our fingertips. But wait. What if we don't have hands or fingertips? Or what if we can't use our hands or fingertips? That introduces some challenges.

#### Voice Recognition

One kind of technology that could potentially help people with motor disabilities is voice recognition, which can allow them to speak to their mobile device. Many mobile devices now come with some level of support for basic speech recognition. Speech recognition would work only if the person's voice is clear enough to be understood reliably, though. A person with cerebral palsy would have a difficult time trying to be understood through voice recognition technology, considering that even most other people would also have a hard time understanding someone with cerebral palsy.

#### Keypads

Looking back a few years, one of the nice things about cell phones for people with visual disabilities was that the buttons were real buttons that you could push down, and there weren't many of them. There were buttons for the numbers, to start or end a call, and to control the volume. That was pretty much all that was available.&#x20;

As cell phone technology evolved, and as phones turned into sophisticated hand-held computer systems, people wanted better keypads, to allow them to type text messages, emails, and perform other typing tasks. The simple number keypad turned into a full-featured keyboard in a very small space.&#x20;

Cramming that many keys into that small of a space meant that the keys had to be very small and close together. That made it difficult for a lot of people to type accurately.&#x20;

The situation was reminiscent of a classic moment in an episode of The Simpsons in which Homer gains a lot of weight. He goes to make a phone call in an emergency situation.&#x20;

### Touchscreen Phones and tablets

With the introduction of touchscreen phones, physical keypads disappeared altogether.&#x20;

In fact, very few physical buttons at all were left on the phone. Nearly the entire set of functions moved to the touchscreen. It was hard to imagine a worse scenario for people who were blind. The early interfaces were completely inaccessible to blind users.&#x20;

Current touchscreen phone and tablet interfaces offer quite a range of accessibility options. They're still not perfect, but they have come a long way toward meeting the needs of users with visual disabilities. Users can choose to use audio output, combined with modified gestures and tapping actions that work for people who are blind.&#x20;

iPhones offer a mobile iOS version of VoiceOver, which is the screen reader that comes with desktop and laptop Macs. VoiceOver for iOS isn't quite as full-featured as its desktop sibling, but it's quite good, especially considering its relative youth.&#x20;

iPhones and other devices also feature options for low vision, such as zoom, large text, and color inversion.
