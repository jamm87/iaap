### Don't Assume Everyone Can See Colors

> Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning. Always supplement color-code information with text explanations.

Most sighted people think of themselves as "visual learners" at least to some degree, so it's natural to use colors and other visual qualities to help explain concepts. Unfortunately, not all people can see colors, so you need to supplement colors with text-based information that doesn't require vision. A person who is completely blind cannot see any colors. A person with low vision may be able to see some or most colors, but the colors may be difficult to distinguish. A person with color-blindness may be able to see most colors just fine, but may not be able to distinguish certain combinations of colors, such as reds and greens.

#### Bad Example

In the following example of a grammar lesson, words have been color-coded to explain the parts of speech. This may work for sighted readers, but screen readers will not mention the colors at all. All of the color-coding is lost on screen reader users. They will still hear the words, but they won't know what colors the words are.

![Color codes:  Magenta = indefinite article Teal = definite article Blue = subject Red = verb Green = direct object Purple = indirect object Orange = adjective Example 1: The bird carried the twig to the nest.  Example 2: The big dog ate my homework.  Example 3: Daniel sculpted a mysterious creature.](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
