# Exam Format

### The Questions on the Exam

The CPACC exam consists of 100 multiple choice questions. There will be no essay questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, or other question formats. The order of the test questions may be random and may differ from one instance of the test to another.

### The Accessibility of the Exam

The exam is in an accessible digital format using industry-standard test administration software. Assistive software — such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, etc. — are available either on the computer provided in the testing center, or the test-taker may be allowed to use their own computer with the necessary accommodations already in place. If you require physical assistive technologies, like adaptive keyboards, pointing devices, or other hardware, you will be allowed to bring your hardware to the exam. The testing center will not provide assistive hardware on site.
