# Renewing Your Certification

From the IAAP website:

Every three years, certificants will be required to:

* Complete 45 hours of continuing accessibility education credits, which must be approved by IAAP.
* Submit an application for certification renewal.
* Pay the certification renewal fee at time of renewal.

For IAAP members, the renewal fee is waived as part of your membership benefits as long as your membership has not lapsed during the three-year period.

For Non-IAAP Members, or those whose membership has lapsed at any time during the three-year period, there is a $200 renewal fee payable at time of renewal. For those in Emerging Economies, the total fee is $75 every three years.

Individuals do not need to retake any of the exams to maintain their certification unless they allow their certification to lapse.

As technologies and professional expectations evolve, these renewal requirements are subject to change.&#x20;

Once you have renewed your certification, your [Credly digital badge ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certification-badges) will be updated with your new expiration date. If you do not renew your certification, your badge will display that it is expired to anyone who views it. If you are displaying your badge outside of Credly, we recommend removing it once it has expired.
