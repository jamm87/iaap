# Other IAAP Credentials

The CPACC is the first credential that the IAAP began to offer. As the name of the credential suggests, someone who is a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies has a strong foundation in the core principles, knowledge, and skills (the competencies) of accessibility best practices. This is the foundation credential for all other IAAP credentials.

### Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)

Another credential that the IAAP has released is the Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS), which is a credential focusing on web and digital accessibility. This is a technical credential suitable for coders, developers, QA testers, and other people who deal with the technical aspects of making digital content and interfaces accessible.&#x20;
