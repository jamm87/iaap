# Scheduling an Exam

The first CPACC exam took place in San Diego on March 22, 2016, concurrent with the CSUN International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference (but not associated with the conference).

Since May 2016, you are able to take the exam pretty much anywhere in the world, either in a testing center, or with a proctor overseeing the administration of the exam. If possible, the IAAP recommends scheduling the exam with a group, to make the experience more cost-effective and efficient for the IAAP.

For more information and to apply to take an exam, go to the [IAAP certification page ![opens in a new window](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/images/template/courses2014/new-window.png)](http://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification) on the IAAP web site.
